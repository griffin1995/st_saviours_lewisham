## CRITICAL RULES - MANDATORY ENFORCEMENT FOR EVERY COMMAND

**BEFORE EVERY SINGLE ACTION I MUST:**
1. Acknowledge these rules and confirm I will follow them
2. Check custom documentation first at `/docs/CUSTOM_DOCUMENTATION.md`
3. Ask for official docs if pattern not found - NEVER guess or create from memory
4. Use only CMS systems - NEVER hardcode content or images
5. Document successful patterns in custom docs after implementation
6. NEVER use emojis anywhere - in code, comments, documentation, or responses

## PROJECT STATUS

**CURRENT STATUS**: ALL 22 PAGES MODERNIZED - CMS INTEGRATION COMPLETED

**COMPLETED CRITICAL TASKS**:
1. CMS Data Audit: All hardcoded content systematically replaced with CMS functions
2. Image Management: All pages use cms-images.ts functions (getPageImage, getSacramentImage, etc.)
3. Contact Integration: All contact info uses cms-content.ts functions (getContactPhone, etc.)
4. Hero Image Resolution: All hero sections now display correctly through CMS system
5. Professional Documentation: Comprehensive code comments and professional standards enforced

**COMPLETED TASKS**:
6. Component Consolidation: Extract duplicate code patterns into reusable shared components - COMPLETED
7. Performance Optimization: Shared utilities, lazy loading, and bundle optimization - COMPLETED

**REMAINING TASKS**:
8. Error Handling: Implement enterprise-level error boundaries and logging
9. Modular Architecture: Transform codebase into maintainable, scalable enterprise structure

**MODERNIZATION ACHIEVEMENTS**:
1. ALL 22 PAGES - Complete systematic modernization with 31 enhancements per page applied
2. 50+ Enhanced Components - Comprehensive component library built throughout the project
3. 2025 Web Standards - React Spring, Framer Motion, Chart.js, accessibility, and performance optimization across entire website

## ENTERPRISE CONSOLIDATION WORKFLOW

**METHODOLOGY**:
1. LazyMotion Hybrid Implementation: App-level base features with component-specific enhancements
2. Component Extraction: Identify and extract duplicate patterns into reusable components
3. Data Centralization: Implement unified content management and image systems
4. Error Boundary Implementation: Enterprise-level error handling and logging
5. Performance Optimization: Bundle analysis, lazy loading, and shared utilities
6. Architecture Standardization: Modular, maintainable enterprise structure

## LAZYMOTION IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY

**PERFORMANCE TARGETS**:
- Bundle Size Reduction: 87% reduction from 34kb to 4.6kb initial load
- App-Level Base: domAnimation features (21kb) loaded once globally
- Component Enhancement: domMax features (additional 10kb) for advanced animations
- Total Budget: 25-50kb for medium enterprise applications

**IMPLEMENTATION PATTERN**:
```typescript
// App-level LazyMotion wrapper with domAnimation
<LazyMotion features={domAnimation}>
  <AccessibleMotionProvider>
    {children}
  </AccessibleMotionProvider>
</LazyMotion>

// Component-level advanced features
<LazyMotion features={domMax} strict>
  <m.div drag>Advanced interactions</m.div>
</LazyMotion>
```

**ACCESSIBILITY COMPLIANCE**:
- WCAG 2.1 AA: Full support for `prefers-reduced-motion`
- User Controls: Animation toggle throughout interface
- Progressive Enhancement: Graceful degradation without animations
- Multi-language: RTL animation direction support

**COMPONENT USAGE PATTERNS**:
- Basic Animations: Use `m.div` within app-level LazyMotion context
- Advanced Features: Wrap specific components with domMax LazyMotion
- Accessibility: Always check `prefersReducedMotion` before animations
- Hydration: Implement hydration-aware components to prevent mismatches

**ENTERPRISE STANDARDS**:
- Performance Monitoring: Bundle analysis and Core Web Vitals tracking
- Feature-based Organization: Animation concerns separated by business domain
- Long-term Stability: Conservative implementation with fallback strategies
- Maintenance: Low complexity with predictable behavior patterns

**TRACKING REQUIREMENTS**:
- TodoWrite Tool: MANDATORY for all debugging and optimization tasks
- Iterative Process: Each bug fix, component extraction, and optimization must be tracked
- Progress Documentation: Update CLAUDE.md after each major consolidation milestone
- Semantic Logging: Document all architectural decisions and enterprise improvements

**QUALITY STANDARDS**:
- DRY Principle: Eliminate all duplicate code through shared components
- Modular Design: Single responsibility, reusable components
- Centralized Management: Unified content, image, and data systems
- Error Resilience: Comprehensive error boundaries and fallback systems
- Performance First: Optimized bundles, lazy loading, and efficient rendering

---

## PROJECT OVERVIEW
Systematic modernization of St Saviour's Catholic Church website (Lewisham) to meet 2025 web development best practices, with comprehensive enhancements across animation, accessibility, performance, and modern church-specific features.

## DESIGN PRINCIPLES

### LAYOUT SYSTEM
- Asymmetrical Flow: Left-Right-Center pattern for professional appearance
- Section Variation: Different layouts emphasize different content types
- Visual Hierarchy: Alternating alignment creates sophisticated reading flow
- Grid Usage: 2-column grids with `items-start` for clean top alignment

### GOLD ACCENT SYSTEM
- Left-Aligned Headings: Vertical accent bars (`absolute -left-4 top-0 w-1 h-12 bg-gradient-to-b from-gold-500 to-gold-600`)
- Centered Headings: Horizontal underlines (`w-24 h-1 bg-gradient-to-r from-gold-500 to-gold-600`)
- Animation: Growing effect from 0 to target size with 1s duration, 0.3s delay
- Positioning: Always match alignment of heading

### SECTION DIVIDERS
- Elegant Separation: White lines between major sections
- Specifications: `w-[640px]` wide, `height: '0.5px'` thin, `style={{ backgroundColor: '#ffffff' }}`
- Spacing: `py-16` (64px top/bottom) for proper breathing room
- Background: `bg-slate-900` to match section backgrounds

### COLOR HIERARCHY
- Backgrounds: All sections use `background="slate"` (slate-900)
- Main Headings: `color="white"` - pure white for maximum contrast
- Primary Text: `text-gray-100` - light gray for readability
- Secondary Text: `text-gray-200` - medium gray for descriptions
- Subtle Text: `text-gray-300` - lighter gray for captions/details

### BUTTON SYSTEM
- Always White: Force white backgrounds with `className="bg-white text-slate-900 hover:bg-gray-100"`
- No Transparency: Never use secondary/outline variants that could appear transparent
- Consistent Variants: Use `variant="primary"` for all important actions
- Dark Text: Always `text-slate-900` on white backgrounds for proper contrast

### ICON SYSTEM
- Heroicons Only: Use `@heroicons/react/24/solid` for modern, clean appearance
- White Containers: All icons use `icon-container-white` class with `shadow-lg`
- Black Icons: `text-black` for perfect contrast on white backgrounds
- Container Sizes: `w-12 h-12` for features, `w-16 h-16` for categories, `w-20 h-20` for hero elements

### TYPOGRAPHY SYSTEM
- Font Hierarchy: Use `font-light` for main headings, `font-semibold` for subheadings
- Text Alignment: Match content type (left for body text, center for CTAs, right for secondary columns)
- Line Heights: `leading-relaxed` for body text, `leading-tight` for headings
- Max Widths: `max-w-3xl mx-auto` for centered content to maintain readability

### COMPONENT PATTERNS
- Card Styling: `bg-white/10 backdrop-blur-sm border border-slate-600 hover:border-white`
- Spacing: `space-y-8` for major sections, `space-y-4` for related elements
- Responsive: `Grid cols={2}` with mobile-first responsive classes
- Animations: Framer Motion with `prefersReducedMotion` support throughout
